App Description: The website I have created is a reaction time game that tests the user 
on therr reaction time. When they click start, they color of the main box will change
to gray and as soon as it turns green, the user must click as fast as possible. If they
click when the box is gray, it will turn red telling them to try again. The user will get
five attempts in one session and after a session is over, their fastest and average score
will be displayed along with a gif.

*Sometimes the leaderboard or the gif will not display. It seems to be an error
with the hosting service because when I tested it locally, it worked fine consistently.
